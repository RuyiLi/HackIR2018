A game that uses Tensorflow/PoseNet and your webcam to control the character.

This game is otherwise known as "idogemu".

Idogemu (移動ゲーム - Literally Japanese for "movement game") is a bullet hell (ish) game with a twist. Instead of using classical controls such as a keyboard/mouse or a controller, this game uses your webcam and controls the character with your arms. You can use your right arm to move the character and your left arm to aim your bullets.
